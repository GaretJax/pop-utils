Title : multi_obj

Version : 1.0

Author : Jean-Francois Roche

Compilation of an application in which we have a chain of objects.

The main create a first object of class myObj1 and call a method of this object. This object create another
object of class myObj2 and call a method of this second object and so on until 4 objects are created. This
build a chain of object of different parallel classes. The first 3 objects are dependant of the object just 
following him :

main --> objectA --> objectB --> objectC --> objectD

To avoid a multiple definition of the broker, the compilation must begin with the compilation on the 
last leaf ( aka objectD ). Then the compilation continue with the element before ( objectC ) and so on until
the main.


Makefile is a very simple example which contains the commands which are used if the compilation would
be made by hand

Makefile2 is a more complete version which contains the directive to manage all dependancies.
