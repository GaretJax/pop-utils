POP-C++ 1.3.1 beta (including Virtual & Secure version)

NOTE: PAROC++ is the former name of POP-C++ so in this transcript, 
at certain places, PAROC++ is stilled used instead of POP-C++.

0. BEFORE STARTING

In order to install properly POP-C++, you will need following software:
 - C++ compiler
 - GNU tar
 - GNU make
 - Flex / Bison. (optional: for parser modification only)
 - zlib


1. COMPILE POP-C++ SOURCE CODE

user@computer$ ./configure 

The configure script can accept the following option: 
   - --prefix=PATH : declare the installation direction
   - --enable-secure : enable the SSH tunneling between parallel object
   - --enable-virtual : enable the virtualization for parallel object execution

Once the configuration script is done.

user@computer$ make


2. INSTALLING POP-C++

user@computer$ make install

You might use sudo or to be root tu execute "make install" if you do not have the right to write in the destination folder. 

The installation script will ask you several questions. Here they are:

   1. DO YOU WANT TO CONFIGURE POP-C++ SERVICES? (y/n)

      You can configure the POP-C++ Global Services by answering "y" to this question. 

   2. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A SIMPLE INSTALLATION ? (y/n)
      
      If you answered "y" at the 1st question, you will be asked if you want to make a simple installation. The simple installation
      will set the default parameters. If you want to parameterize the POP-C++ Global Services, answer "n".

3. TESTING YOUR INSTALLATION

The release directory contains a test suite. This test suite is located under ./test

You can execute the test suite by running the "runtests" script. 

user@computer$ ./runtests
